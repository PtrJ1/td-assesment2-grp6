## Technical Direction for 3D Animation and Graphics Projects (41801)  
### Assessment Task 2: Developing Part of a 3D Animation / VFX Pipeline  

---

#### Objective  
Students are required to work in small groups with individual tasks to create tools for a section of a 3D animation / VFX pipeline. Deliverables include functional computer code, documentation, and evidence of Agile methodologies and usage of Git.

---

#### Part 1  
Each member of the group will present at least one section of the presentation which will contain the following:

- **Production Schedule and Plan (Group Assessed)**
  - A schedule for the work, with milestones, and the student who is assigned to work on each tool.
  - Planned folder structure with Work in Progress (WIP) and Publish areas.
  - Data types to be passed between departments.

- **Pseudocode (Individually Assessed)**

- **Git Repository**
  - Academic staff will need to be given access to the repository.

---

#### Part 2  
Each individual will present the tool they have developed to show that it works in conjunction with the other tools developed by their group. Additionally, groups will present:

- Functional computer code that works with both Unix and Windows file paths.
- User documentation for each tool.
- Usage of a Git repository showing the frequency and quality of commits for each individual student in the group.

#### Repository Folder Structure  
 src/: Source code for all tools.

           asset_publisher/: Code for the asset publishing system.

           integrity_checker/: Code for the asset integrity check tool.

           lighting_scene_builder/: Code for the tool that builds a lighting scene.

   docs/: Documentation for each tool.

   tests/: Temp folder to test unfinished or rough scripts and assets to verify the functionality of tools.

   assets/: Sample 3D assets for demo purposes.

   .gitignore: A file specifying patterns of files/folders that Git should ignore. (e.g., *.pyc, *.log, etc.)

---

#### File Naming Convention  

- **Asset Publishing System**: `ap_`
- **Integrity Checker**: `ic_`
- **Lighting Scene Builder**: `ls_`

For example:  
- Lighting scene pseudocode = `ls_pseudocode`
- Asset publisher test code = `ap_test`
